# Currency-Converter

User Story: As a user of the Currency Converter program, I want to see additional features that enhance the usability and flexibility of the application. This includes handling multiple currencies, allowing historical conversion rates, and incorporating error handling for better user experience.  

Sprint 3 Tasks:  

Add Support for Multiple Currencies:  Task: Extend the Currency Converter program to support conversion between various currencies, not just a fixed set. Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to input different currencies (e.g., USD to EUR) and receive accurate conversion rates. Implement Historical Conversion Rates:  Task: Enhance the program to allow users to view historical conversion rates for a specific date. Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to input a date and get the exchange rates for that particular day. Refactor Code for Modularity:  Task: Review and refactor the code to ensure modularity. Create separate functions/methods for different functionalities (e.g., handling user input, currency conversion, error handling). Acceptance Criteria: The code should be organized into logical, reusable units, making it easy to maintain and extend. 

Sprint 4 Tasks: 

Implement Error Handling:  Task: Introduce error handling mechanisms to handle cases such as invalid user input, network errors during currency rate retrieval, etc. Acceptance Criteria: Users should receive meaningful error messages when inputting incorrect data, and the program should gracefully handle unexpected errors. User-Friendly CLI Interface:  Task: Improve the Command Line Interface (CLI) for better user interaction. Provide clear instructions and a user-friendly interface. Acceptance Criteria: Users should find it easy to understand how to input currencies and dates. The program should guide the user through the conversion process. Implement Automated Tests:  Task: Write automated tests to ensure the correctness of the currency conversion logic and the error-handling mechanisms. Acceptance Criteria: The automated tests should cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, historical conversions, and error conditions. General Guidelines for the Fresher Developer:  Focus on code readability and maintainability. Break down tasks into smaller steps, and make incremental progress. Document code and functions to help others understand your implementation. Regularly communicate progress and seek feedback from the team. Test your code thoroughly, and consider edge cases and boundary conditions. Note: Encourage the fresher developer to ask questions, participate in code reviews, and seek assistance when needed. It's essential to foster a collaborative and supportive environment for learning and growth.
